* [ ] Implement an TCP (or UDP?) server for J2ME and other technology-based apps
* [ ] Implement indicator icons and various images formats support
* [ ] Find a workaround for missing indicators bug until any system indicator is shown on Symbian Belle
* [ ] Implement tap handling/callbacking for indicators
* [ ] Implement a plugin for status pane top indicators
